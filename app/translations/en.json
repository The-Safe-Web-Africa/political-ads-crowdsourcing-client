Moreover, access to this API is only possible with a Facebook account whose identity has been validated by sending an ID to Facebook. <br>For some countries, Facebook provides a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/?source=archive-landing-page&country=GB\">detailed report</a> publicly available, but it does not yet exist for European Union countries other than the United Kingdom. <br>We want to make these ads available to all citizens that everyone can ensure their legality.",
