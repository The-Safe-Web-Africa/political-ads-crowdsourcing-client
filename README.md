# Political Ads Legality

The main purpose is to allow the evaluation of the legality of advertising in the context of the European elections, since Facebook does not yet provide a complete advertising report. We start with Facebook and France but we have a vocation to extend it to the widest possible audience and contributions are very welcomed.
