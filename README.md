The goal of this work is to allow the evaluation of the legality of political advertisement on digital platforms in the context of the European elections.

It focuses on political advertisement on Facebook and France but we intend to extend it to more sources. Your contributions are more than welcome.


## Relationship with Library reports

For some countries (as of writing US, UK and Brazil), a [public report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/?source=archive-landing-page&country=GB) is available. Such reports make ads explorable through a web interface, and offer a CSV database as well. Facebook opened their Library for all EU countries mid-April. However, the public report is not available for most. This exposure of data is thus currently the only way for people without a certified Facebook developer account and technical know-how to access the data. This work might thus not be as necessary when such reports are opened for all other countries.

## License

EUPL v1.2: akin to an AGPL, but more readable and translated and legally binding into all languages of the EU. [Recap](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/eupl-1.2/).
